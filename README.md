# MCMC_NHEK1

Here is the code which builds the near-extremal gravitational waveforms using the flux data a0.98,0.998 and a0.999 999 999 
Tuekolsky data for the flux. In the code Fluxes, one needs to change paths to the location of the directory containing the flux
data above. 

The Waveform_Code.py script is the script which actually builds the waveforms. In this code, I try to compute Fisher matrices
to estimate how well we can measure certain parameters.

The other codes are my attempts to perform MCMC to estimate the parameters.
